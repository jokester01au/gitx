User Manual
-----------

This is the GitX user's manual. This document tries to explain the most common used features and explains the concepts that might be confusing if you've never used a git GUI.

### Disclaimer

GitX aims to be a graphical wrapper around the most-frequently used
git-commands, enabling you to satisfy your daily git needs in one consistent
program. GitX doesn't aspire to be a complete interface for the wide variety
of git command-line programs with their ever-growing number of options. It's
also no easy way to learn git. A sound understanding of how git stores data,
how it works on that data and how to recover from (accidental) deletion of
branches and commits will not only help you with git but will also enable you
to learn GitX with greater confidence and speed. Since GitX is far from
complete you'll probably still have to use it in conjunction with the
command-line git for more complex tasks, such as merging or performing remote
operations.
