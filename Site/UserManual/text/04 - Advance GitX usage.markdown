### Advance GitX usage


While GitX can be used just fine without ever touching the terminal, some of
it's power can currently only be used through the command line utility.

You can install this utility by choosing "Enable Terminal Usageâ€¦" from GitX's menu. This will ask you if GitX is allowed to install the `gitx` utility in `/usr/local/bin`. After you have done this, you can use gitx from the terminal in any Git repository!

To become familiar with this utility, you can read it's short help message:

	Tirana:UserManual pieter$ gitx --help
	Usage: gitx --help
	   or: gitx (--commit|-h)
	   or: gitx <revlist options>

		-h, --help          print this help
		--commit, -c        start GitX in commit mode

	RevList options
		See 'man git-log' and 'man git-rev-list' for options you can pass to gitx

		--all                  show all branches
		<branch>               show specific branch
		 -- <path>             show commits touching paths

As you can see already, `gitx` has some useful options. To quickly start committing, use `gitx -c`.

However, to really make use of all the options, you should read the `git-log` and `git-rev-list` man-pages. Gitx takes most of the commands that normal git utilities also take.

For example, if you want to show commits that change lines with the word 'cool' in it, you can use:

	gitx -Scool

and to see commands that touch only files in the "Documentation" directory, you can use

	gitx -- Documentation

You can also specify which branches gitx should display, for example:

	gitx commit_view log_options --grep="fix" --author=Pieter

will show all commits in the `commit_view` and `log_options` branches that have the word 'fix' in their commit message and which are committed by Pieter.

If you have a lot of commits, you can choose to limit the output. For example,

	gitx -1000

will only show the first 1000 commits. Limiting commits can be useful in other contexts too. For example, if you want to know what you have committed that isn't on the remote yet, you can use

	gitx origin/master..

If there are changes both on a remote and on your local side, you can show them at once with the _symmetric set difference_:

	gitx --left-right origin/master...HEAD

will show commits that are only on your side OR only on the remote side. The `--left-right` options does some other magic: instead of the usual circles GitX uses in the branch lines, it will now use an arrow pointing left for commits only on the left side (that is, in `origin/master`), and an arrow to the right for commits only on the right side. For example, when I issued the same command on this repository, I got:

![Showing --left-right](images/UserManual/left-right.png)

You can also pipe any command that produces a diff to GitX to see its changes.
For example, to compare version 0.5 and version 0.6 of GitX, you can do the following:

	git diff v0.5 v0.6 | gitx
